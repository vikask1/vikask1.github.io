      <h5 class="card-title">Who Are Detectives ?</h5>
      <img src="download.png" class="img-fluid" alt="detective's image" style="margin-top: 2%; margin-bottom: 1%;">
      <p class="card-text">Informally, and primarily in fiction, a detective is a licensed or unlicensed person who
        solves crimes, including historical crimes, by examining and evaluating clues and personal records in order to
        uncover the identity and/or whereabouts of the criminal.

        In some police departments, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes
        the requirements for being a police officer. In many other police systems, detectives are college graduates who
        join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers. Some people[who?] argue that
        detectives do a completely different job and therefore require completely different training, qualifications,
        qualities and abilities than uniformed officers. The opposing argument is that without previous service as a
        uniformed patrol officer, a detective cannot have a great enough command of standard police procedures and
        problems and will find it difficult to work with uniformed colleagues.

        Some are private persons, and may be known as private investigators, or as "The Eye That Never Sleeps" – the
        motto of the Pinkerton Detective Agency or shortened to simply "private eyes".</p>
      <h5 class="card-title" style="margin-top: 3%; margin-bottom: 1%;">Techniques Used By Detectives</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Detectives have a wide variety of techniques available in conducting investigations. However,
        the majority of cases are solved by the interrogation of suspects and the interviewing of witnesses , which
        takes time. Besides interrogations, detectives may rely on a network of informants they have cultivated over the
        years. Informants often have connections with persons a detective would not be able to approach formally.
        Evidence collection and preservation can also help in identifying a potential suspect(s).</p>
      <h5 class="card-title" style="margin-bottom: 1%; margin-top: 3%;">
        History Of Detectives
      </h5>
      <p class="card-text" style="margin-bottom: 4%;">Before the 19th century, there were few municipal police
        departments, though the first had
        been created in Paris in 1667. As police activities moved from appointees helped by volunteers to professionals,
        the idea of dedicated detectives did not immediately arise. The first private detective agency was founded in
        Paris in 1833 by Eugène François Vidocq, who had also headed a police agency in addition to being a criminal
        himself. Police detective activities were pioneered in England by the Bow Street Runners and later the
        Metropolitan Police Service in Greater London.The first police detective unit in the United States was
        formed in 1846 in Boston.</p>

              having both hands amputated at the age of 11, Armes spent a brief period in California acting before
              setting up a detective agency in El Paso. He served eight years as Chief Deputy Constable for the El Paso
              County Constables Department, and now charges approximately $1million per private investigation case.</p>

              the chief investigator in the Zodiac killer case, which is still unsolved today. He was portrayed in the

            <p class="card-text">Born in Glasgow in 1819, Allan Pinkerton became a detective and spy, the first in
              Chicago after emigrating there as a young man. Pinkerton's agency solved a series of train robberies
              during the 1850s, bringing Pinkerton into contact with the Illinois Central Railroad, and the company's
              lawyer, a young chap by the name of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

            Vidocq's life inspired the works of Hugo and Balzac, and there's a biographical film about him too. Vidocq
            became the founder and first director of the first known private detective agency, and is considered to be
            the father of modern criminology and the French police department.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Mary Doyle is the Chief Superintendent of the Manchester Police Force. Joining when she
            was only 20, she’s had nothing short of an illustrious career. In 2011 she led an intense national
            investigation into the murder of Indian student Anuj Bidve and helped put his killer – who dubbed himself
            ‘Psycho’ – behind bars. She now helps manage the policing of a city with over 27 organised crime syndicates.

          <p class="card-text">Kate Warne was the first and only female detective Allan Pinkerton ever hired, and she
            was deeply influential. Hired because she could make the acquaintance of women more easily than men could,
            she soon found herself in the middle of the Pinkerton agency’s grandest exploits. Her career saw her
            uncovering stolen fortunes, hunting down the occasional murderer and rescuing President Lincoln from an
            assassination attempt. All in a day’s work for one of history’s least appreciated sleuths.</p>

            achieved the most number of arrests and convictions between 1920–1925. They were known nationally for
            successfully shutting down speakeasies, using disguises in their work and going undercover in bars where
            their faces were on the wall. They made 4,392 arrests of which 95% gained convictions. By 1930, both men
            were working as insurance salesman after being ousted by jealous colleagues.</p>

            social activist, Kiran Bedi turned her hand to policing. The first woman officer in the entirety of the
            Indian Police Force, Bedi found herself keeping the peace in the midst of tense political protests. She set
            up civilian volunteer groups to patrol areas the police couldn’t quite cover and clamped down on
            bootlegging, sexual assault and institutional corruption in Delhi. All on her first few postings.</p>

            his job put him face-to-face with some of the toughest figures in the commonwealth. To cope, he started
            developing his own martial arts techniques and teaching them to the rest of the Shanghai Police Force. The
            systems he developed would eventually evolve into what he called Defendu, a comprehensive self-defence
            science he'd one day teach to World War II Commandos. </p>
